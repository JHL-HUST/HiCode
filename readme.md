# HICODE
----------

## Compiling

Before compiling, the following software should be installed in your system.

* g++
* Xeltex
* R packages 

Compile both the base algorithms and the HICODE program.  

```sh
$ sh compile.sh
```

After compiling, you should see a binary file 

```sh
$ ./Main
```

## How to Run

Rename the graph file to "graph", and put it into director
```sh
$ ./data/GRAPH_NAME/
```

* The graph file's first line indicating the number of vertex.
* The following lines containing 'i j w' representing an edge between (i,j) with weight w.
* Then write a config file for the graph , named "GRAPH_NAME.config" . 
See configuration details in the next section.

Run HICODE using command:

```sh
$ ./Main GRAPH_NAME.config
```

### Example

```sh
$ ./Main config/synl2.config
you will find the community detection results in
$ ./result_directory/{maxLayer, maxOriginal}*.gen
and the ground truth communities are in
$ ./data/synl2/Layer1.gen
$ ./data/synl2/Layer2.gen
```

## Configuration Details

In config file, each row include a pair of Parameter:Value .
see 'config/synl2.config' as an example.

| Parameter | Description       |
| --------- | -----  |
| DATA_DIR  | The data directory|
| RESULT_DIR | The result directory|
|Ground_Truth | The ground truth (only the partition type should be listed)|
| SingleLayer_Method | The base algorithm of the framework. 'Modularity'/'Infomap'|
| Frameworks | The type of framework , separated by ';' if want multiple. 'Remove'/'Reduce++'|
| Framework_CommunitySizeThres | The threshold for leftover|
| Number_Of_Layers | The choosen Layer Number |
| Number_Of_Iteration | The choosen Iteration Number |
| WeightedGraph | TRUE/FALSE indicating if the weighted graph should be used |
  
#### TIPS
The weakening method 'ReduceWeight' in paper indicates the 'Frameworks' should be 'Reduce++' and the 'WeightedGraph' should be TRUE.

## Code Structure

### Framework
The current framework is implemented in 'Framework_Reduce.h' etc., and the base class is 'Framework.h'. The most important function that need to be implemented is 'calcNextLayerGraph(Graph cur,Community comm)', which gives the current graph and a set of community, return value is the reduced graph.

### Base Algorithms
The current framework is implemented in 'SingleLayer_Modularity.h' etc., and the base class is 'SingleLayer_Method.h'. The most important function that need to be implemented is 'generateCommunity(string graphFile,string communityFile)', which takes in the graph file and using the algorithm to generate the communities and save in communityFile.
